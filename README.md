# 🖼️ Image to Pencil Sketch 🎨

A simple yet effective Python project that converts real-world images into pencil sketches using OpenCV. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates the use of core image processing techniques in a fun and creative way.

## ✨ Features

- Converts color images to pencil sketch style
- Applies grayscale conversion and image inversion
- Uses Gaussian blur for smoothing
- Blends images to generate realistic sketch effect
- Visual output displayed using Matplotlib

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📁 How It Works

1. Load the image using OpenCV
2. Convert the image to grayscale
3. Invert the grayscale image
4. Apply Gaussian Blur to the inverted image
5. Blend the grayscale image with the blurred inverted image to produce the sketch
